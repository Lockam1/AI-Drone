## Idea
The goal is trying to make a drone that is automatically controlled which can preform task and travel from point A to point B, avoid obsticals and diliver and item and return to its home without destroying itself. We ar going to use the exsiting farmbot battlebot chassis as a 2d platform to test and demo the main functionality that the drone will have and then take this to an actuall drone.
