## Idea
The goal is trying to make a drone that is automatically controlled which can preform task and travel from point A to point B, avoid obsticals and diliver and item and return to its home without destroying itself. We ar going to use the exsiting farmbot battlebot chassis as a 2d platform to test and demo the main functionality that the drone will have and then take this to an actuall drone.

- Input coordinates from your current location or a intended destination.
- The drone will pull the data and plot a waypoint to the destination.
	- This will be done using a python script that runs when the Pi is connected to the internet at home.
- Find a sutiable waypoint mission route to get to the intended location in as little time as possiable.
- The drone will take full AI control when it arrives within the poximity of the location to find a suitable place to land.
- Static or dynamic site?
